                <p>Hello, I'm Joel John K, and I come from the bustling city of Delhi, where I was born and raised.</p>
                <p>Growing up in such a dynamic environment shaped my outlook on life and fueled my passion for learning
                </p>
                <img src="bcg1.jpg " class="img">
                <p>My academic journey began at  St. Columbas School, a place where I not only built a strong educational
                    foundation but also discovered my love for Computer Science.</p>\
                <p>The time I spent at my school with the teachers being both professional and friendly and my peers,
                    who made my life as a student so much more enjoyable, was indeed the most memorable part of my
                    school life.</p>
                <img src="stcolumbas.jpg" class="img">
                <p>My time at  St. Columbas School was not just about academics, it was where I honed my skills in various
                    extracurricular activities, including debating and sports. These experiences helped me develop a
                    well-rounded personality, teaching me the importance of balance between studies and personal
                    interests.</p>
                <p>The colony where i grew up in plays a huge role in who I am today.From trustworthy and extremely
                    funny(trust me they'll make your stomach hurt laughing) to being there when I needed them the most,My friends
                    were truly  gems.</p>
                <img src="nrc.jpg" class="img">
                <P>Last but not the least, My parents. The sole reason for me to be what I am today. From teaching
                    values to being the most chill parents in the world, they were exactly who I wanted them to be when
                    i needed them</P>
                <p>I’m extremely thankful for all the incredible people in my life who have shaped me into the person I
                    am today. Their guidance, support, and encouragement have been invaluable, and I’m forever grateful
                    for the impact they’ve had on my journey.</p>
